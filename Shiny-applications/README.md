# Overview of the applications  
This folder contains examples of interactive applications created with RStudio's Shiny package:  
- The first example (atlas_corpus) demonstrates, how to combine atlas and corpus data of the same linguistic alternations. Three alternating phenomena have been chosen for illustration: the phonological realization of the word 'summer' (suvi/sui) and the word 'bigger' (suurem/suuremb), and the morphosyntactic alternation between analytic and synthetic negation forms 'is not' (ei ole/pole).
- The second apllication (simple_correspondence) conducts a simple correspondence analysis on analytic and synthetic parallel constructions in Estonian dialects.  

The commented code itself is in the application folders and is named app_eng.R. The code can be run in RStudio.  
The rest of the files in the application folders are shapefiles and frequency tables, necessary for producing the intended output.
